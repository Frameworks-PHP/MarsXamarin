# Mars Mission: Xamarin

## Mission Brief
Your crew on Mars has lost contact with Earth and as a result, your team is lacking a few essential functions.

However, your team brought a bot along that could help to re-establish the connection. In order to interact with the bot effectively, we need to make an interface to interact with it. 

After establishing a connection, We also need to create a tool that can patch our camera feed into our Computer Vision API, in order to identify unknown objects.

## Pre-requisites
Go through this [install document](https://github.com/jamesleeht/MarsXamarin/blob/master/INSTALL.md).

## Introduction
Xamarin allows you to write your code base once in C#/.NET and have it deployed across the 3 popular mobile platforms, iOS, Android and Windows Phone.

In this Mars Mission guide, we will learn how to:

1. Connect our Xamarin app to a bot and have an interface to interact with it.
2. Use the Microsoft Computer Vision API on camera images from the app
