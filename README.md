# Mars Mission: Xamarin

## Mission Brief
Your crew on Mars has lost contact with Earth and as a result, your team is lacking a few essential functions. Some of the people on your team are using iPhones, while the others are using Android devices.

As we need a tool that works across all the team's devices, we will be building an application in Xamarin.

Your team has brought a bot along that could help to re-establish the connection. However, to interact with the bot effectively, we need to make an interface to interact with it. 

After establishing a connection, We also need to create a tool that can patch our camera feeds into the Computer Vision API, in order to identify unknown objects.

## Pre-requisites
Go through this [install document](https://github.com/jamesleeht/MarsXamarin/blob/master/INSTALL.md).

## Introduction
Xamarin allows you to write your code base once in C#/.NET and have it deployed across the 3 popular mobile platforms, iOS, Android and Windows Phone.

In this Mars Mission guide, we will learn to build a Xamarin Forms app that:

1. Connects to a bot and has an interface to interact with it.
2. Use the Microsoft Computer Vision API with camera images from the app
