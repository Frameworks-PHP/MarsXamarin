# Mission 2: Making an interface to interact with the bot

## Introduction
In this mission, we will learn how to create a simple Xamarin UI using XAML.

This UI will contain a `ListView` for displaying the messages between the user and the bot, as well as an `Entry` for sending messages to the bot.

We will also learn how to bind data, as well as use the class we made in Mission 1 to work with the bot.

## Main Page
In the project, there should be a `MainPage.xaml`. This `.xaml` file represents the first page your application will default to when you start it.

Every `.xaml` file also has a "Code Behind" file which can be used to contain the code and logic for that page. You can see this file by clicking the small arrow next to the `MainPage.xaml` file and clicking on `MainPage.xaml.cs`.

In this tutorial, we will be using both the `.xaml` and `.xaml.cs` files to design the UI and make it work.
