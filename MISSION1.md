# Mission 1: Connecting a bot to Xamarin
In this repository, you'll find a pre-configured Xamarin.Forms shared project.

This project is a blank Xamarin.Forms Shared project that has the Bot Framework DirectLine nuget installed across 3 platforms: Android, iOS and UWP. 

The DirectLine nuget will have a set of classes and methods that aid with connecting to the bot that we found on Mars.
